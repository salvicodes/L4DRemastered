## Graphics and Design

Animations and graphics can be remastered or ported from the game, there are amazing models that are on Sketchfab, I will be contacting the author to ask for permission to include those models in this project.
 
## UI and UX

Preferably, the UI and UX are updated to be slightly more modern, but with the same dark grim feel that the originally came with opening up the Left 4 Dead experience.  Since I also produce sound effects and music, I'd also be able to contribute a great amount of sounds, and modify older ones.

## Timeline

Our project time frame is still to be determined, but game engine votes close as soon as we have over 50 votes.
